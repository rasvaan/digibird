In the worst case, systematic favoritism for a certain type can render other parts of the collection invisible to users. This potential bias can be evaluated by measuring the “retrievability" for all documents in a collection. We explain the ideas underlying the retrievability metric, and how we measured it on the KB Newspaper collection.  We describe and quantify the retrievability bias imposed on the newspaper collection by three different commonly used Information Retrieval models. For this, we investigated how document features such as length, type, or date of publishing influence the retrievability.\nWe also investigate the effectiveness of the retrievability measure, featuring two characteristics that set our experiments apart from previous studies: (1) the newspaper collection contains noise originating from OCR processing, and historical spelling and use of language; and (2) rather than the simulated queries used in other studies, we use real user query logs including click data. We show how simulated queries differ from real user queries regarding term frequency and prevalence of named entities, and how this affects the results of a retrieval task.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Slides:</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>[slideshare id=59685452&amp;doc=20160317kb-160317160255]</div>',

But while some clothes and accessories are easily found and identified, others are obscure and require a trained eye to describe. What are we looking at? What kind of sleeve is this? Which materials and techniques have been used? More specific descriptions of the images facilitate better use of digital collections and enable users to wander through them in detail.\r\nThe Rijksmuseum and Modemuze are looking for specialists and enthusiasts with a passion for fashion and costume to join an expedition through their digital collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nModemuze is an online platform and network of 11 Dutch museums, including Rijksmuseum, with a fashion and costume collection: Amsterdam Museum, Centraal Museum Utrecht, Fries Museum Leeuwarden, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, Museum Rotterdam, Paleis Het Loo, Rijksmuseum, Tassenmuseum Hendrikje, TextielMuseum, Theatercollectie Bijzondere Collecties UvA, Tropenmuseum, Afrika Museum, Museum Volkenkunde.\r\n\r\n<h4>Annotating the collections</h4>\r\nResearchers from <a href="http://wm.cs.vu.nl">VU University Amsterdam</a>, Delft University of Technology and the Centre for Mathematics and Informatics and the Rijksmuseum (in the context of the COMMIT/ SEALINCMedia project) have developed Accurator: an online tool to improve the process of annotation of digital collection objects, e.g. being able to find relevant objects to annotate, annotate specific parts of an object, etc. Following \'Birdwatching in the Rijksmuseum\', this time the Accurator tool will be used to describe fashion related objects from the Modemuze and Rijksmuseum collections.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the fashion annotation event are also invited to record their findings in the Wikipedia Encyclopedia, Wikimedia Commons and in Wikidata, Wikipedia’s open database. Wikipedia volunteers as well as staff from the Rijksmuseum and Modemuze will be present for support throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<h4>Program</h4>\r\n9.30 - 10:00   Registration and Coffee\r\n10:00 - 10:10 Introduction of the <a href="http://www.accurator.nl/">Accurator tool </a>\r\n10:10 - 12:00 Annotating fashion in the digital collections (using Accurator)\r\n12:00 - 12:30 Discussion on the use and future of fashion annotation\r\n\r\nParticipation in the event is free, but registration is required. To register, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:accurator@rijksmuseum.nl">accurator@rijksmuseum.nl</a> with your name and your interest in fashion. (We will take your subject preferences into account when setting up the Accurator tool.) If you have any questions regarding the event, please feel free to email them to this address.\r\n \r\nIMPORTANT: The event will take place in the Cuypers Library of the Rijksmuseum. The following guidelines need to be taken into account:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>On the 23rd of April you can report at the RIJKSMUSEUM desk in the Atrium. Please bring your confirmation of registration. Without this, entry can be denied.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bring your own laptop. There are strict safety guidelines in the Library, which limit the use of laptop power supplies. Please make sure the battery is fully loaded to last for 3 hours without further charging.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.accurator.nl">www.accurator.nl</a> (general info)\r\n<a href="http://annotate.accurator.nl">annotate.accurator.nl</a> (annotation tool)\r\n<a href="http://www.modemuze.nl">www.modemuze.nl</a>\r\n<a href="http://www.rijksmuseum.nl">www.rijksmuseum.nl</a>\r\n<a href="http://wm.cs.vu.nl">wm.cs.vu.nl</a> (Web &amp; Media group at VU)',

    content: '<p style="text-align:left;">On the 5<sup>th</sup> of February 2016 the kickoff meeting for the COMMIT/ valorisation project DigiBird took place. The meeting was hosted by the <a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/" target="_blank">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid). During the meeting, the people who will work on the project were introduced, together with the partners involved.</p>\r\n\r\n[slideshare id=58137062&amp;doc=digibirdkickoffmeeting5february2016-160211075734]\r\n\r\nThe DigiBird project builds on the results of the SEALINCMedia project, aiming to use crowdsourcing results to integrate three different media types: <strong>images</strong>, <strong>sounds</strong> and <strong>videos</strong> - all related to birds. The various datasets that belong to these different media types are provided by the partners involved in the project. Most of these platforms already use crowdsourcing as a means of annotating the bird media, but there is no single point of access for all of them and no means of crossover access. Thus, the goal of DigiBird is to achieve this integration by creating cross-links between collections and designing user-friendly interfaces. These will not only help to enable access to the various bird collections, but will also motivate people to contribute more knowledge by means of annotations.\r\n\r\nThe people who will work on developing this project are Chris Dijkshoorn - a PhD student and Cristina-Iulia Bucur - a student assistant, both affiliated with VU University Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe partners involved in DigiBird are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:left;">The <a href="http://www.rijksmuseum.nl" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum Amsterdam</a>, involved in the development of the SEALINCMedia Accurator <a href="http://www.accurator.nl" target="_blank">Accurator</a> platform that allows experts to annotate <strong>images</strong> of artworks.</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/" target="_blank">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> - develops the <a href="https://github.com/beeldengeluid/waisda" target="_blank">Waisda?</a> open source crowdsourcing video annotation software. An instance of this software will be used to annotate <a href="http://natuurbeelden.nl" target="_blank">Natuurbeelden</a>, providing an online game that enables users to annotate <strong>videos</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href="http://www.xeno-canto.org/" target="_blank">Xeno-canto Foundation for Nature Sounds </a>they have one of the most extensive collection of bird <strong>sounds</strong> in the world that is created and validated by bird enthusiasts.</li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.naturalis.nl" target="_blank">Naturalis Biodiversity Center</a> is maintainer of the <a href="http://www.nederlandsesoorten.nl">Nederlands Soorten Register</a>, an overview of species in the Netherlands. Besides an interesting source of images, this is also an ideal point of integration. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids="694,693" type="rectangular"]\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting, a hands-on breakout session took place. During this session, the participants from the various partners could create their own view on how the interfaces could look and also how the user interaction can be dealt with by building various scenarios.',

The required shift in research methods has the cost of working with digitally processed historical documents. Therefore, a major concern for the scholars is the question how much trust they can place in analyses based on noisy representations of source texts.\r\n\r\nBased on interviews with humanities scholars and a literature study, we classify scholarly research tasks according to their susceptibility to errors originating from OCR-induced biases. Search results for "Amsterdam", for example, are likely to be influenced by the confusion of the letters "s" and "f", especially for material that was created before 1800, when the "long s" was still used.\r\nIn order to reduce the impact of such errors, we investigated which kind of data would be required for this and whether or not it is available in the archive.\r\n\r\nWe describe our study of example research tasks performed on the <a href="http://www.delpher.nl">digital newspaper archive </a>of the National Library of The Netherlands. In this study, we tried to reduce the uncertainty of the results as much as possible with the data publicly available in the archive.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the current knowledge situation on the scholars’ side as well as on the tool makers’ and data providers’ side is insufficient and needs to be improved.\r\n\r\n[embed]http://www.slideshare.net/MyriamTraub/impact-analysis-of-ocr-quality-on-research-tasks-in-digital-archives[/embed]',

In your own garden, in nature, and also in art. Among the Rijksmuseum’s 1,2 million collection objects are many prints, paintings and artefacts that have bird species depicted on them. Among the 37 million objects in the Naturalis collection are many birds from all over the world that have been collected in the last 200 years, as well as historical drawings of plants and animals in which many birds are depicted.\r\n<h3>Wikimedia Commons</h3>\r\nSome of the depicted birds are easily identified. Others require a trained eye to determine which species the artist has pictured. The Rijksmuseum and Naturalis are looking for experienced bird watchers and other avian enthusiasts to join an expedition through their digital collections and help the museums identify bird species in works of art.\r\n\r\nThe Rijksmuseum and Naturalis are currently in the process of donating large parts of their digitized collections of bird images to Wikimedia Commons, Wikipedia’s open multimedia library. Participants of the birdwatching day are challenged to collaboratively identify as many bird species depicted on these images as possible and record these in Wikimedia Commons and in Wikidata, Wikipedia’s open database.\r\n<h3>Accurator</h3>\r\nFor this purpose <a href="http://www.commit-nl.nl/" target="_blank">COMMIT</a>/<a href="http://sealincmedia.wordpress.com" target="_blank">SealincMedia</a>,  a consortium of Dutch researchers from the <a href="http://wm.cs.vu.nl" target="_blank">VU University Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a> and the <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica</a> (centre for mathematics and informatics), has developed a dedicated online tool for the Rijksmuseum. With this tool, called <a href="http://www.accurator.nl" target="_blank">Accurator</a>, common and scientific names of species depicted in artworks can be recorded in an intuitive way. Participants of the birdwatching day will use this tool to tag bird species.

The contributions are mainly in the form of tags which describe certain aspect of the cultural heritage object. With a wide range of users on the web, it becomes important to determine the quality of the user contributed content before it is published online. However, manually evaluating the quality of these user generated contributions is exhausting in terms of resources for the Cultural Heritage institutions. In this talk, I will describe methods which can semi-automatically predict the quality of tags. These methods address three research questions: How can we trust an online contributor?, How can we assess the quality of annotation process?  and  How can we trust the contributed data?. The slides for the presentation can be found <a title="Rijksmuseum Presentation on Trust" href="http://www.slideshare.net/dreamgirl314/rijksmuseum-presentation-36455522">here</a>.',
