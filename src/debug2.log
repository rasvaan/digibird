    content: '<p style="text-align:left;">On the 5<sup>th</sup> of February 2016 the kickoff meeting for the COMMIT/ valorisation project DigiBird took place. The meeting was hosted by the <a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/" target="_blank">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid). During the meeting, the people who will work on the project were introduced, together with the partners involved.</p>\r\n\r\n[slideshare id=58137062&amp;doc=digibirdkickoffmeeting5february2016-160211075734]\r\n\r\nThe DigiBird project builds on the results of the SEALINCMedia project, aiming to use crowdsourcing results to integrate three different media types: <strong>images</strong>, <strong>sounds</strong> and <strong>videos</strong> - all related to birds. The various datasets that belong to these different media types are provided by the partners involved in the project. Most of these platforms already use crowdsourcing as a means of annotating the bird media, but there is no single point of access for all of them and no means of crossover access. Thus, the goal of DigiBird is to achieve this integration by creating cross-links between collections and designing user-friendly interfaces. These will not only help to enable access to the various bird collections, but will also motivate people to contribute more knowledge by means of annotations.\r\n\r\nThe people who will work on developing this project are Chris Dijkshoorn - a PhD student and Cristina-Iulia Bucur - a student assistant, both affiliated with VU University Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe partners involved in DigiBird are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:left;">The <a href="http://www.rijksmuseum.nl" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum Amsterdam</a>, involved in the development of the SEALINCMedia AccuratorÂ <a href="http://www.accurator.nl" target="_blank">Accurator</a> platform that allows experts to annotate <strong>images</strong> of artworks.</li>\r\n\t<li style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/" target="_blank">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> - develops the <a href="https://github.com/beeldengeluid/waisda" target="_blank">Waisda?</a> open source crowdsourcing video annotation software. An instance of this software will be used to annotate <a href="http://natuurbeelden.nl" target="_blank">Natuurbeelden</a>, providing an online game that enables users to annotate <strong>videos</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href="http://www.xeno-canto.org/" target="_blank">Xeno-canto Foundation for Nature Sounds </a>they have one of the most extensive collection of bird <strong>sounds</strong> in the world that is created and validated by bird enthusiasts.</li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.naturalis.nl" target="_blank">Naturalis Biodiversity Center</a> is maintainer of the <a href="http://www.nederlandsesoorten.nl">Nederlands Soorten Register</a>, an overview of species in the Netherlands. Besides an interesting source of images, this is also an ideal point of integration. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids="694,693" type="rectangular"]\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting, a hands-on breakout session took place. During this session, the participants from the various partners could create their own view on how the interfaces could look and also how the user interaction can be dealt with by building various scenarios.',
